We develop advanced high-level synthesis techniques that enable efficient translation from high-level behavioral descriptions to optimized hardware implementations. Our work focuses on:

### Dynamic Pipeline Architecture

Automated generation of pipelined datapaths from CADL specifications, enabling efficient hardware implementation of complex algorithms.

### ISAX-Specific Scheduling

SDC-based scheduling with ISAX-specific constraints, optimizing the timing and resource utilization of custom instructions.

### Latency-Insensitive Design

Transaction-based hardware construction for flexible timing, allowing modular and composable hardware design.
