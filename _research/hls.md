We develop advanced high-level synthesis techniques that enable efficient translation from high-level behavioral descriptions to optimized hardware implementations. Our work focuses on:

## ISAX-Specific Scheduling

SDC-based scheduling with ISAX-specific constraints, optimizing the timing and resource utilization of custom instructions.

## Hybrid Latency-Sensitive/-Insensitive Design

Combining static and dynamic HLS scheduling techniques to generate pipelined datapaths for efficient ISAX acceleration.

## High-performance Architecture Support

Diving into HLS analysis and transform techniques as well as spatial-temporal transformation to create design of high parallelism to meet performance requirements.
