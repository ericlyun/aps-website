summary: Demonstrating practical impact across diverse domains and benchmarks
---

Our research demonstrates practical impact across diverse domains. We also propose benchmarks (to come soon) for comprehensive evaluation of processor specialization works.

## Application Domains

### Post-Quantum Cryptography

NTT acceleration for CRYSTALS-KYBER. We develop specialized hardware for lattice-based cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks.

### Machine Learning

Quantized LLM inference (BitNet). Our work enables efficient deployment of large language models through hardware-aware quantization techniques.

### Digital Signal Processing

IIR filters and phase-locked loops. We provide optimized implementations for common DSP kernels using custom RISC-V instructions.

### 3D Point Cloud Processing

Real-time geometry processing for applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and AR/VR systems.


## Benchmarking

More kernels or applications from diverse domains with comprehensive metrics to evaluate instruction customiztion from multiple aspects.f
