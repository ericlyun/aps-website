We pioneer new approaches to hardware description through our CADL and CMT2 frameworks:

### CADL (Cross-level Architecture Description Language)

Unified language for ISAX specification from high-level behavior to low-level implementation. CADL bridges the gap between algorithmic description and hardware realization.

### CMT2

Rule-based hardware description in Rust with temporal semantics. CMT2 enables cycle-deterministic hardware design with modern programming language features.

### Transactional Hardware

Modular and composable hardware design methodology that simplifies the development of complex systems through well-defined interfaces and protocols.
